# digital-identity-project
This project's server is built with Node.js and uses Python scripts for OCR and RSA encryption. It receives image requests from the app, extracts information from the images using Python, RSA encrypts the data, and returns it encrypted to the app. The server is also designed with security measures such as encryption of data at rest and in transit.
This is just a prototype,there is a lot to improve, \n
The next phase is to developpe a production ready solution
